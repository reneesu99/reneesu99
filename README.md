## About READMEs!
### What is a README? 
They're an explanation for a piece of code that can be an application, a game, or any piece of code really. 





They are a text file located in the project's folder.
A good README should be to the point, clear, and complete!


### What exactly is in a README?

A good README should generally contain:
1. the title and overview for the project 
2. the current build status (if there are any bugs)
3. visual media
4. the tech stack
5. how to install
6. how to use
7. how to contribute
